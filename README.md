   \textbf{Abstract.} Information asymmetry among bidders is prevalent across various auction formats, whether implicit or explicit. I employ familiarity networks to investigate a semi-perfect information auction framework characterized by information asymmetry, ex ante learning, and arbitrary network structures. In this model, risk-neutral bidders compete for the allocation of a good by submitting sealed bids according to specified allocation rules (first- or second-price), where each bidder possesses local knowledge about a subset of others' values, determined by the underlying network structure. Key findings include: (1) In second-price auctions, truthful-telling (i.e., bidding one’s true valuation) constitutes an equilibrium for any structure of the familiarity network. In first-price, a pure strategy equilibrium exists, where the front-runner (i.e., the bidder with the highest valuation within her familiarity set) bids between the second-highest valuation and her own, with non-unique equilibria in both formats. (2) The Revenue Equivalence Theorem fails under mild assumptions; second-price auctions are efficient, while first-price auctions yield lower expected revenue with partial local information. (3) Bidders gain more surplus in first-price, but this leads to inefficient allocations with positive probability. (4) In first-price, expected revenue is nonmonotonic as bidders’ familiarity increases; it initially decreases with partial information but increases as bidders gain full information. (5) Under mild regularity conditions, increasing bidders intensifies competition in first-price auctions, though the impact of network skewness is nonmonotonic. These results provide insights into the equity-efficiency tradeoff in mechanism design, and is applicable in contexts like emissions trading, enterprise competition, and online bidding algorithms.
